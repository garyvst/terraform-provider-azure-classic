# Terraform Provider for Azure Classic

## Please Note

This repository is for the Terraform Provider for Azure Classic (also known as Service Management / "the old Portal").

Today (December 19, 2017) [we’ve announced the deprecation and archival of the Azure Classic Provider](https://hashicorp.com/blog/deprecating-the-microsoft-azure-legacy-asm-terrafor). Matching Microsoft’s commitment to gradually remove access to Azure Classic (or Service Management) [which is outlined in this blog post](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/azure-portal-updates-for-classic-portal-users/), we are closing all open PR's and Issues here. This repository will remain available here on GitHub, but in an archived state, and no longer receiving support or new releases.

[The Azure (Resource Manager) Provider](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm) remains fully supported and is our recommended approach for managing Azure with Terraform. More information about this process is available in the blog post linked above.
